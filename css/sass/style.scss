//Siren Framework v2.0
//File Name: Style Collector
//File Purpose: Collects all files in an OOCSS friendly order
/*File Notes: 

Style order should be as follows

Base: reset then unclassed styles (not including forms); these can be issolated as a suitable fall back (called in basic)
Layout: Grid system or custom layout
Classed Elements and Components: Header/Footer, form, then classed objects
Style Trumps: Special classes like error messages
Responsive

- There will be a default directory setup but this can change. For instance, if we need two layout partials then we create a folder
