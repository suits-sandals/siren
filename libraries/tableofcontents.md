### About Directory ###
This directory holds the PHP libraries used in Siren and houses files associated with Composer which is used for dependency management and autoloading. While Composer is often found in the root directory of a project I have stuffed it in here since it was just recently added to Siren and I'm quite new to it. It still functions as normal. It may be moved to the root directory at some point.
