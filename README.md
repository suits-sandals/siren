Siren is the work horse scaffolding of Suits & Sandals, LLC. It strives to provide simple building blocks in order to make coding quicker. 

Siren uses SCSS with Compass, Grunt, the OOCSS philosophy, and uses PHP with HTML5 for markup. These are the standards of the SaS development team.

Siren uses the standard of the Suits & Sandals development team which is as follows:

MARKUP
- Semantic HTML5 with a focus on assessibility
- HTML5 is generated through PHP, which allows for RESS techniques, automating the creation of repeating patterns, and for templating

STYLES
- SCSS with Compass
- The Modular Scale and Vertical Rhythm Compass plugins are used to keep font consistency
- A variation of the BEM naming convention is used
- Always strive for OOCSS, keep things modular, it helps everyone out

FONT-END SCRIPTING
- Javascript; the Suits & Sandals teams has a small functions library for dealing with common use cases
- Javascript is minified and concatinated into page and viewport specific files and served through PHP if statements only when appropriate
- the jQuery library should be used only when there isn't a simple solution without it

TOOLS
- Grunt for task automation
- Imagemin and Grunt Responsive Images for being smart with image filesizes
- jsHint and Uglify for beautiful and compress code; accordingly
- Yuidoc for the JS documentation
- Compass for SCSS processing
- Grunt watch to make it all so easy

KEY CONCEPTS
- Assessibility
- As fast and light as possible
- Front end developers are type setters, code to make things beautiful
- RESPONSIVE! 
- Responsible responsive design!
- Progressive enhancement
- Have fun!
