## Philosophy ##
Siren is an extension of its creator's, Zachary Brady, key philosophies in regards to the creation of websites and applications. The core tennants of this philosophy are:

- Performance: A great website MUST be optimized for speed and percieved performance.
- Accessibility: A great site MUST be accessible to all possible users regardless of physical or mental handicap, browser or device usage, or internet connection speed. 
- Progressive Enhancement: Advanced features should not be applied in a way that hinders the basic experience. Websites are a peanut M&M with Semantic HTML5 as the peanut, smartly applied CSS3 as the chocolate, and Javascript/enhanced features as the candy coating.
- Mobile First Responsible Responsive Design: All web projects must adhere smartly applied responsive design. The base must be the mobile experience with adjustments made through media queries as the browser expands
- Code Cleanliness: Code must be kept clean and logical. Documentation and coding logs must be created alongside the coding process and either kept within the project or linked to.
- Coding Must Be Fun: It just has to be or we'll get bored quickly and our code will suffer for it.
